# Google-CAPE-Final-Project
This was a project made for the Google CAPE Program during Summer 2012. 
It is a game called "Brick-out Word Assembler", in which players form words after hitting letter bricks using a ball and a virtual moving platform.
This was developed using the Processing language for the initial graphical interface, and Python for the section where
text is rearranged.
